          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the
          valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such,
          we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
        </p>

            when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you,
            including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a
            contract with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we
            believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and
            those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
            For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes
            described in order to:

          <li>
            <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe
            it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with
            a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or
            disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it
            is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party,
            such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
          Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your
          privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
          and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
          not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
          follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
          Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or
          honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
